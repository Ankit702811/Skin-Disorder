Skin Disorder

Domain: Healthcare

Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict
the various classes of skin disease.

Task3:-Suggestions to the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at
the earliest.

*  Erythema- Redness of Skin.

*  Scaling-  Scaling skin is the loss of the outer layer of the epidermis in large, scale-like flakes.

*  Definite borders- Skin lesion (i.e area of skin that are different from the skin around them)should have definite borders.

*  Itching

*  Koebner phenomenon- The appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary to trauma.

*  Polygonal-Papules- Papules and polygonal plaques are shiny, flat-topped, and firm on palpation.

*  Follicular Papules- The follicular papules are small rough bumps that appear in round or oval patches, which extend and spread rapidly over a few                           days to affect large areas of skin.

*  Oral Mucosal Involvement- The oral mucosa is the “skin” inside of the mouth, including cheeks and lips, can be the reason of skin disorder.

*  Knee-Elbow-Scalp involment- Psoriasis is common on your: Scalp, Elbows and knees. Psoriasis is a chronic (long-lasting) disease in which the immune     system becomes overactive, causing skin cells to multiply too quickly.Patches of skin become scaly and inflamed, most often on the scalp, elbows, or    knees are affected.

*  Family history- Some skin conditions have a genetic basis; examples: Atopic eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis and keratoderma.

*  Melanin incontinence-Characterised by spillage of melanin(a dark brown to black pigment occurring in the hair, skin, and iris of the eye in people      and animals. It is responsible for tanning of skin exposed to sunlight) from the basal keratinocytes into the underlying connective tissue of the       lips.

*  Eosinophils in the infiltrate-It is infilteration of Eosinophils that are a type of white blood cell that protect your body from parasites,             allergens, foreign bacteria and outside organisms.

*  PNL infiltrate- It is infiltration of Pure Neural Laprocya (Laprocy meaning-contagious disease that affects the skin, mucous membranes, and nerves,     causing discoloration and lumps on the skin and, in severe cases, disfigurement and deformities)

*  Fibrosis of the papillary dermis- Thickening or scarring of the tissue of the thin top layer of the dermis(the inner layer of the skin).

*  Exocytosis- It is a process by which a cell transports secretory products through the cytoplasm(the jelly-type liquid that fills the inside of a        cell) to the plasma(liquid component of blood) membrane.

*  Acanthosis- A thickening of the skin,caused by an increased number of specialized squamous cells on the surface.

*  Hyperkeratosis- A condition marked by thickening of the outer layer of the skin, which is made of keratin (a tough, protective protein).

*  Rete ridges- The extension of epidermis into the dermal layer.

*  Clubbing -Clubbing is changes in the areas  under and around the toenails and fingernails that occur with some disorders,

*  Elongation of rete ridges - Increase the length of extension of epidermis into the dermal layer.

*  Thinning of the suprapapillary epidermisa- thinning of the granular layer at the tips of the papillae.

*  Spongiform pustule-Formation of a sponge-like network of cell remnants in the upper epidermal layers, in whose meshes neutrophil leukocytes         are embedded.

*  Focal hypergranulosis-Focal Hypergranulosis means for limited area increased number of cells in the granular layer of the skin.
*  Munro microabcess-Microabscesses composed of pyknotic neutrophils and lying within the parakeratotic areas of the stratum corneum are one of       the  characteristic histological features of early psoriasis vulgris.

*  Disappearance of the Granular layer- Granular layer is an important layer of skin.It contains an epidermal cell called 'Keratinocytes'            which produces keratin(Protein). The disappearance of granular layer may cause the an unhealthy s kin.
* Vacuolisation and damage of basal layer- Basal cells are found at the bottom of the epidermis — the outermost layer of skin. Basal cells produce new skin cells. As new skin cells are produced, they push older cells toward the skin's surface, where the old cells die and are sloughed off. vacuoles(small cavity) and damaged of basal layer will not produce new skin.
* Spongiosis-Spongiosis is mainly intercellular edema (abnormal accumulation of fluid) in the epidermis.
* Sawtooth appearance of retes- Similar saw tooth appearance may be seen in lichen planus(a condition of the skin,hair,nails,mouth and genitals).In the                                 mouth and genital mucosa,lichen planus forms lacy white patches,sometimes with painful sores.
* follicular horn plug- It is conical, keratotic mass(like wart) that arises in areas of chronic(continuing) inflammation.
* Perifollicular- Inflammation of the tissues surrounding the hair follicles.
* Parakeratosis- Parakeratosis refers to incomplete maturation of epidermal keratinocytes, resulting in abnormal retention of nuclei in the stratum                      corneum. It occurs in many diseases of the skin, particularly in psoriasis.
* Inflammatory mononuclear Inflitrate- The ability of mononuclear cells to infiltrate neighbouring tissues and cause inflammation.
* Band-like infiltrate- It is an Affects and obscures the basal epidermis, classically with a band like pattern. Sometimes the infiltrate is patchy.
* Age- Your skin changes with age.It becomes thinner, loses fat, and no longer looks as plump and smooth as it once did.Your veins and bones can be            seen more easily. Scratches, cuts, or bumtake no longer to heal.
*  Class- Here are 6 types of diseases given: Psoriasis, Seboreic Dermatitis, Lichen planus, Pityriasis rosea, Cronic dermatitis, and Pityriasis rubra pilaries.<br><br> **Psoriasis**-Psoriasis is a chronic (long-lasting) disease in which the immune system becomes overactive, causing skin cells to multiply too quickly. Patches of skin become scaly and inflamed, most often on the scalp, elbows, or knees, but other parts of the body can be affected as well. It can begin at any age.
